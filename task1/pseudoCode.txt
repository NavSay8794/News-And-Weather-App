Steps:

1. Check for array's length. if less or equal to 1 return array else continue to 2.
2. calculate the mid index value of the array.
3. divide the array into left and right based on mid and repeat steps 1,2,3 
   till left_Array.length = 1 and right_Array.length =1
4. call sortingFxn and pass left and right as parameters
5. In sortingFxn, compare the two array values and store the smaller one first and then the bigger one in results array
